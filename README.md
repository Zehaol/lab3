I used the reading that we did on the VR to came up with this idea of making a game. I also asked some classmates about what they thought about the idea and they said it is interesting and encrouged me to do it. However, creating a interactive game is more diffcult than what I thought. And the project is even more time consuming than I expected. Sorry that I could only submit a half way product now, I will probably complete it when I got some more free time. The idea is that you will start with in a seneary of a place and you can walk in to a room. The room will start the test and test your geo knowledge on some place. after compeleting all the questions the room will take you to a gallery showing some picture or information about the topic.
I designed this game basically for anyone who want to test their knowledge about Tibet. But if I am able to write the code and other stuff all down. Changing the topic of the game is super easy. It could worked as a template for other question and answer model. I did write the interactive part and the basics of the game here. But it is not totally complete. Answering questions in this way may lead the audience to a better understanding of the topic. And they might remember the questions better. Instead of answering questions of a piece of paper, they got the chance to do it in a VR. 
There are several points that I thought about invloving in this project. First of all, All the correct answers should come along with a picture and statement about the place. For example when the gamer choose Qumulangma for the correct answer, they will recive a video and audio explaining some interesting fact about the place. Also I thought about creating a timer for the game. When cilcking start, the timer will start, and when the gamer finished the last question. the timer will show up and tell the audience how long it takes for them to complete all of the questions. Also I thought about creating sound effects on to correct answers and wrong answers. Lastly, I want to creat some kind of award for the people who went through the process. Maybe a cute certificate about compeleting the game or a chance to see all the beautiful places around the topic.
